The common cold is an acute, self-limited viral infection of the upper respiratory tract (commonly rhinoviruses). Treatment is supportive.

Typical symptoms:

Self-care and symptomatic treatment:
- Rest and fluids
- Analgesics/antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen/ibuprofen) for pain/fever (use per label and clinician advice)
- Saline nasal irrigation and humidified air can provide symptom relief
- Short-term (≤3 days) topical decongestant sprays may relieve congestion (avoid prolonged use)
- Antibiotics are NOT effective unless there is bacterial superinfection confirmed by clinician

When to see a clinician:
- High fever (>38.5°C) >3 days, severe sore throat, shortness of breath, chest pain, persistent or worsening symptoms, or symptoms in high-risk patients (immunocompromised, elderly)
