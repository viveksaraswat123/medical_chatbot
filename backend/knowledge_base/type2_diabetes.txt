Overview:
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder resulting from insulin resistance and/or inadequate insulin production, causing persistent hyperglycaemia.

Key facts (short):
- Pathophysiology: peripheral insulin resistance + impaired β-cell insulin secretion → high blood glucose.
- Typical diagnostic thresholds (for clinical reference only): Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (confirm per guidelines). Always confirm with a clinician or guideline source.

Common symptoms:
- Polydipsia (increased thirst), polyuria (frequent urination), polyphagia (increased hunger)
- Unintended weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision
- Recurrent infections, slow wound healing, distal sensory neuropathy (tingling/numbness)

Major risk factors:
- Overweight/obesity (central adiposity)
- Physical inactivity
- Family history of diabetes
- Age >45 years, certain ethnicities
- Hypertension and atherogenic dyslipidemia

Principles of management (general guidance):
- Lifestyle: individualized medical nutrition therapy, reduce refined carbohydrates, weight loss, and ≥150 minutes/week moderate activity where safe.
- Monitoring: home/self blood glucose or continuous monitoring per clinician's plan; regular HbA1c monitoring as advised by provider.
- Pharmacotherapy: first-line agents often include metformin (unless contraindicated); many other classes exist (SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, insulin etc.) — medication selection and dosing must be decided by licensed clinicians.
- Complication prevention: blood pressure and lipid control, annual foot and eye checks as indicated.

When to seek medical care:
- New onset of classic symptoms, very high glucose readings, dehydration, ketonuria, or any signs of diabetic ketoacidosis.
- Urgent/Emergency: severe dehydration, altered mental status, rapid breathing — call emergency services.
