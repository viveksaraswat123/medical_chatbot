Overview:
Hypertension is sustained elevation of arterial blood pressure; persistent uncontrolled hypertension increases risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and kidney disease.

Key facts (short):
- Many guidelines classify blood pressure categories—confirm current thresholds from local/national guidelines. (Example thresholds vary across guidelines; check your clinician's guideline source.)

Symptoms:
- Most people are asymptomatic. Possible nonspecific symptoms at very high levels include headache, visual changes, chest discomfort, or shortness of breath.

Major risk factors:
- Age, family history, overweight/obesity, high dietary sodium, physical inactivity, tobacco use, excessive alcohol.

Management principles:
- First-line: lifestyle modification (DASH-style eating, low sodium, regular aerobic exercise, weight control, limit alcohol).
- Pharmacotherapy: thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers; choice individualized by comorbidities and contraindications.
- Monitoring: home blood pressure monitoring recommended in many guidelines; regular clinical follow-up for medication adjustment.

When to seek care:
- If new symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, or signs of hypertensive emergency (severe BP elevation with organ dysfunction) occur — seek emergency care.
- Routine screening and follow-up with a primary care clinician are critical.

Safety note:
- Medication decisions and urgent management require a licensed provider. Do not stop or start medication without clinician guidance.
