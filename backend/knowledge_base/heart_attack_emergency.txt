Tags: emergency, cardiology

Core emergency signs:
- Chest pain/pressure that is new, severe, or lasts > few minutes
- Pain radiating to arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach
- Shortness of breath, diaphoresis (cold sweat), nausea, lightheadedness, fainting

Immediate action (clear and short):
- CALL local emergency services immediately (e.g., 911/112)
- Do NOT delay. If trained, administer CPR or use an AED for cardiac arrest.
- Chew aspirin (if not allergic and if advised by emergency dispatcher or clinician) only if recommended by emergency services.

Important:
- Time-critical: early reperfusion saves myocardium. Transport to nearest emergency department immediately.
- This is emergency information — not a decision tool. When in doubt, call emergency services.

Safety note (to always be appended):
- This is an emergency guideline only. Always call local emergency services for suspected heart attack.
